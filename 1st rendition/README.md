## Setup

Install depedencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. Then create a .env file within the folder and add this in the file "OPEN_API_KEY=(your api key no parentheses or apostrophes)" Note that we probably aren't going to use Jupyter the whole way, I was just using it to create the proof of concept.
